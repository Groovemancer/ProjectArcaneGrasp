# Project Arcane Grasp
A Tactics RPG made with XNA, Monogame, and C#

# TODO:

- Hex Tile Maps that can load in multiple layers
- Multiple height layers for tiles that will appear taller than others. Higher depth (or lower, not sure) to make it appear in front of tiles that aren't on that height layer
- Should layers themself have xoffset and yoffset along with a depth mod to create heights? Probably a better way to go.
- Load Maps from some kind of data file
